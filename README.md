# spotify-analysis

This read me is intended for others who want to examine their spotify listening history.

You can request your data files on the spotify privacy page (https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/).
The data comes in .json format, probably in several different files.

The first step is to combine these into one file, then transform it into .csv format for easier analysis in tableau, excel, etc.
Use the combine_json_to_csv.py file, changing the path variable to the appropriate path, where your data is located.
